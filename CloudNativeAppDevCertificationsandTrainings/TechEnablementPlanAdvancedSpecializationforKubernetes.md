Cloud Native Accelerate Partner Enablement Resources
When partners sign up for Cloud Native Accelerate partner initiative (CNA), they agree on the following:
•	Meet requirements for Kubernetes on Azure Advanced Specialization within 12 months after agreeing on the onboarding plan
Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure Advanced Specialization allows partners with an active Gold Cloud Platform Competency to further differentiate their organizations, demonstrate their proven success in deploying and managing production workloads in the cloud using containers and managing hosted Kubernetes environments in Microsoft Azure, and build stronger connections with customers.
Requirements decomposed
Successful technical enablement plan for CNA should help partner to meet the requirements of Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure Advanced Specialization within a year. Let’s decompose those requirements into specific actions:
1.	One unique individual must pass Azure Administrator Associate certification – AZ-103 exam (will be replaced by AZ-104 in April 2020)
2.	One unique individual must pass Azure Developer Associate certification – AZ-203 exam (will be replaced by AZ-204 in February 2020)
3.	One unique individual must pass Azure DevOps Engineer Expert certification – AZ-400 exam
4.	One unique individual must pass Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification – exams AZ-300 and AZ-301 (will be replaced by AZ-303 and AZ-304 in April 2020)
5.	One unique individual must pass Azure Security Engineer Associate certification – AZ-500 exam
6.	At least 2 full-time employees with CKA or CKAD certification (requirement 1.1 in the audit checklist) – individual must pass CKA or CKAD exam
7.	Show monthly Azure Kubernetes Service ACR – partner should have deep knowledge of AKS and AKS cluster operations at scale.
