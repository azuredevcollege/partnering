# Cloud Native App Dev Trainings & Certifications #

Obviously Microsoft has a ton of resources to keep you busy. So you might ask yourself what do I really need to be "ready"? Here's our recommendation to all developers:

![Cloud Native App Dev Tech Readiness Recommendation](./AppDevLearningPath.png)

First of all, take a test on (aka.ms/MSPracticeTests "Measure Up") to assess your current knowledge and learn about your development areas.

## Courses ##

Start with some online courses. Complete learning path are available on  Microsoft Learn oder Pluralsight. Tipp: Create your learning profile with your private email address and conect this to your professional/company's account. This way, you can take the certification with you from one to the other employer (of course we do not want to motivate anybody to change jobs).
