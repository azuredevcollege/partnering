## Step 4: Select and Achieve competencies

Aligned to the needs of customers, Microsoft competencies let partners demonstrate their areas of technical capability.
Competencies showcase the partner's level of tech expertise towards a customer. Some of our large customers even prefer to work with so called "certified" partners only. Partners can attain over 20 competencies across Microsofts solution areas. 
There are two levels of competence: Silver and Gold. To achieve a competency, partners must either reach a certification or performance goal. Further after completing these requirements, a fee will be charged in Partner Center before the status is changed in the partner profile.

Here are a few tips:
+ Select a competency that resemples you technical skills
+ If it's hard for you to show performance, select a competency which only requires # of certified employees  
+ It is not a competition, you can save resources (monetary and personelle) if you start with one gold competency in the area that showcases your expertise the most 
+ As a service partner: get at least one Gold status in one competency; it is relevant to achieve co-sell status and many other benefits

Partner receive a number of benefits for achieving competencies. In particular, IURs/licensing, markting servces, support etc. The benefits differ based on the difficulty of the competency.
