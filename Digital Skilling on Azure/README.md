## Certifications ##
+ Microsoft certifications prove that a person has the skills to help organizations maximize the capabilities of the cloud to achieve desired business outcomes.
+ Certifications are updated regularly to reflect business and technology pace of change. 
+ Certifications remain technically accurate and relevant with updates occurring every 2 months and adding additional roles and specialties as the market requires it.  
+ There are three types of certifications, each one to validate different aspects of how you use technology to solve business problems.
  + *Fundamentals*: Validate your foundational understanding, with mixed concepts and applied learning, of Microsoft technologies. They are a springboard into deeper role-based learning paths and certifications. No experience required in the area.
  + *Role-based*: Focus on solutions rather than just products to validate technical skills required to perform industry job-roles on Microsoft platforms and technologies. Multiple levels of expertise: Associate and Expert
  + *Specialty*: Validate deep technical skills and ability managing industry solutions, including 3rd-party solutions, on or with Microsoft platforms. No associate or expert levels.

To help learners prepare for certification exams, Microsoft partners with Measure Up to offer official practice tests. Visit aka.ms/MSPracticeTests to discover available Microsoft practice tests.
